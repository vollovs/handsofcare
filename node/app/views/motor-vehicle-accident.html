							<p>After you are involved in a motor vehicle accident (MVA)
								or car accident, you should be evaluated by a professional
								physiotherapist. You do not need a referral from a medical
								doctor to visit a physiotherapist. You do not need to wait for
								paperwork from your insurance company before the physiotherapy
								visit. We have all the paperwork you need. We help you to
								complete all the forms which can be overwhelming for you. You
								should have called your insurance company representative and
								have your claim number ready.</p>
							<p>Itâ€™s critical to visit a physiotherapist ASAP after the
								injury. The fist week is very important for your future
								recovery. We offer treatment and education to help you to handle
								the symptoms. If your symptoms are not improving after the
								second week, it may last two or three months. You may feel fine
								in the first two days, some symptoms show up after that and it
								can be very hard to control them if we miss the critical stage.
							</p>

							<p>In September 2010, healthcare providers, insurance
								companies and the Ontario government developed one new Injury
								Guidelines for people with MVA injuries to speed access to
								recovery. After the initial assessment, your physiotherapist
								will designate your injuries as Minor or Major according to the
								guidelines. Minor injuries have a maximum mount of $3,500 for
								treatment, Major injuries have $50,000. A minor injury would be
								a sprain, strain, bruise, superficial skin abrasions or cuts,
								partial joint dislocation, or whiplash without neurological
								problem or serious spine damage. This amount of 3500 includes
								ALL your expenses i.e. physiotherapy, massage, chiropractic,
								acupuncture, gauze bandages, braces, splints etc</p>
							<p>Some medical condition previously existed before the
								accident that was worsened by a minor injury will entitle you
								with more treatment benefit more than the limited to minor
								injury. When the physiotherapist decides your injury is in the
								Major injury catalogue, your auto insurance company may still 
								want to have a second opinion by sending you for an independent medical assessment.</p>
							<p>Physiotherapy and massage therapy visits are covered by
								your insurance. Treatment is expected to be complete in twelve
								weeks, starting from initial visit for assessment. If you
								require equipment to exercise at home and products to help with
								pain like hot/cold packs, braces, or back supports your health
								care provider can provide them for you without getting approval
								from your insurer or as long as the total cost is under $400.
								The cost for these products is in addition to your $3,500 for
								treatment.</p>
