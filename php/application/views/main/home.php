							<p>Welcome to Hands of Care Physiotherapy Clinic
								Physiotherapy is about getting you better. Here you will be in a
								partnership and we are going to treat you as an important member
								of the team. Our physiotherapists are passionate about getting
								people better. We will work together.</p>
							<p>During our first interview, we will perform a thorough
								assessment. Then we will tell you what’s happened to you and
								what we can do for. You are also going to learn the progression
								of your condition.</p>
							<p>As you continue, please let us know how you feel. We’ll
								listen to you and adjust our approach. We’ll teach you what you
								need to know to manage and improve your condition, and also to
								help you prevent it from happening again. While we love our
								patients, our goal is for you to get better and not need us
								anymore. If we think you need to consult a specialist, we’ll
								coordinate with your referring physician, and get you to the
								best specialists for your particular need.</p>
							<p>Physiotherapy is the art and science of restoring function
								and maximizing performance. Our style of physiotherapy uses
								manual therapy, exercise, education, movement analysis, and
								ergonomics to help you uncover the source of your injury.
								Massage therapist and acupuncturist also form part of our team.
								We want you to leave feeling well, and with the necessary tools
								to prevent further injury.</p>
